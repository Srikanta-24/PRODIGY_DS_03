Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
This project uses a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The data is loaded from a CSV file and the decision tree is trained using the scikit-learn library. The model is then evaluated on a held-out test set and the accuracy is reported.

Introduction
The Decision Tree Classifier is a widely used machine learning algorithm that provides a clear and interpretable decision-making process. In this project, we focus on predicting whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic attributes (such as age, gender, income) and behavioral data (such as browsing history, previous purchases).

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 87.32% on the held-out test set. This means that the model correctly predicted whether a customer would purchase a product or service 87.32% of the time.
